# 👋 Hi, I’m Charles

Former **IT Project & Product Manager**, now on a journey to become a **Full-Stack Developer**.

After more than 10 years leading digital projects for **Chanel**, **L’Oréal**, **SNCF**, **Alstom** and the **City of Montréal**, I realized something essential:  
💡 *I don’t just want to design solutions — I want to build them.*

---

## 🚀 About Me
- 🎯 **Past life:** 10+ years in tech consulting & product management — from rebuilding Alstom’s IT services for 50 000 users to launching a clienteling app for L’Oréal’s luxury stores.  
- 💻 **Current mission:** Becoming a hands-on full-stack developer — because understanding users and designing experiences is great, but building them takes me even further.
- 🏫 **Next step:** Starting an **AI Web Development Bootcamp** and finding an apprenticeship.  
- 🌍 Based in **Bordeaux**, France.

## 🧠 Tech Stack in Progress
- **Frontend:** HTML · CSS · JavaScript · React  
- **Backend:** Node.js · Express · PostgreSQL  
- **Other explorations:** Python · Git · Figma

## 🧩 Projects

### 🥦 Recipe Season Feasibility Checker *(WIP)*
A project that analyzes recipe ingredients and provides users with the best months to cook them, based on Greenpeace’s seasonal fruits and vegetables calendar.  
Next step: building a **React UI**.

### 🪶 [JanKenPon](https://ortender.github.io/JanKenPon/)
A fun take on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, JS**, this project goes beyond the tutorial expectations — featuring "animations" and a playful UX.

## 🧭 From Product to Code
Throughout my career, I’ve managed complex ecosystems and multidisciplinary teams —  
but the most rewarding part has always been **bridging business, design, and technology**.

Now, I want to be the **bridge**.

## 🏔️ Beyond Code
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me **climbing**, **playing handball**, or **hitting a few balls on the tennis court** — I love staying active and challenging myself.  

I’m also a big **board game enthusiast**, always on the lookout for new games and innovative mechanics. For me, it’s one of the best ways to **meet people, share ideas, and explore creativity through play**.  

And when I’m at home, I love spending time in the kitchen — **trying out new recipes** and experimenting with flavors. One day i want to be able to **create my own dishes from scratch**.
